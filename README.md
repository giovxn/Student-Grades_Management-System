# Student-Grades_Management-System
This project demonstrates a solid understanding of data structures and related programming concepts.

The Student Grades Management System is a system that takes students information including name, student id and their enrolment type. The author of this assignment submission is Giovanni Icasiano Jr, a student in Murdoch University. The date when this document was created is 27th of July 2024. The main java files names are Student.java, Student_Course.java, Student_Research.java, Unit.java, Unit_Course.java, TestStudent.java, student.csv, studentMarks.csv.

The Student Grades Management System is designed to manage student information, including names, student IDs, and enrollment types. The system reads data from CSV files, processes the information, and provides functionalities like sorting and reporting grades. Assumptions include that input data in the CSV files is correctly formatted and that the program will output sorted student lists and grade reports based on this input.

How to use the program:
- Once you are presented with a menu, you can choose out of the 8 menu choices on what you would like to do with the program.
  - It is recommended to store studentMarks.csv to database before to use the programs full capabilities (press 2 then type studentMarks.csv).
- Once the student marks were successfully stored, you can choose any of the menu choices to its full capabilities!
  - If you chose 3, you are able to input a student ID to remove any student from the array list data base, this includes their marks aswell.
  - If student is not found, program will send you back to the menu.
  - If you chose 4, the program will output all available student details including their enrolment type and date of birth
  - If you chose 5, the program displays the average mark of all course students and displays how many students are above the average and below average.
  - If you chose 6, the program will ask for a student ID to search for the grade inforation of that student, this shows the final grade and overall mark of that student.
  - If the student is not found, program will send you back to the menu.
  - If you chose 7, the program will sort the array list data base to ascending order based on the student’s student ID, and this will display the students data on the terminal screen.
  - If you chose 8, the program will ask for a .csv file to store the student’s details in that csv file you typed in in ascending order of student ID.
    - This will not work if user did not sort the program
- Ones you are done, press 1 and you have successfully used the program!
